TheTechniqueIndex is an easy-to-use website that allows you to find and discover MMA techniques, not only showcasing their demonstration, but also their Japanese name, related techniques and also offering a full-site search to learn more about a move.

TheTechniqueIndex is made for people who already train, that already have an understanding of martial arts and that are being followed by a coach and a teacher/professor. As such the website is not made for the common Joe to learn to fight online (because it's impossible) or to learn party tricks that will probably lead to injury.

TheTechniqueIndex (and the developer) discourages said behaviors and it's not liable for any content present on the page or for its misapplication by non-experts in any way. If a copyright holder notices an infringement, the developer apologizes and asks to be contacted <a href="mailto:andrealicheripakunza@gmail.com" style="color: white;">here</a> to remove said infringement immediatly.
